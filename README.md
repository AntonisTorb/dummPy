# DummPy
An application that produces fake (dummy) data for Data analysis practice.

Please take a look at the [User Guide](https://github.com/AntonisTorb/dummPy/blob/main/User%20Guide.pdf) before using the application, where you can find instructions on how to run and use the application. If you discover any bugs or have any suggestions, feel free to open an issue. Pull requests are welcome as well, but since I am a begginer (it took me 2 weeks and a lot of google searches to reach version 1.0.0), I might not fully understand your code, so please be patient :) 

## For the future:
- There are currently no plans to further enhance or modify DummPy. Any issues will be fixed if discovered.

## Recent changes (v1.2.0):

- New data type: String
	- Generate random strings that include characterrs based on user selection.
	- See the User Guide for full information.
- Removed unused import from "main.py"
- Improved error handling throughout the code.
- Renamed some PySimpleGUI element keys to better represent their source.
- Some comment relocation.
